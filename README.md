> A codebase forged in discipline, built to pursue strength in every domain.  
> Built for the hybrid athlete.

## The Origin

**OmniaFortis** draws its name from Latin roots:
- **"Omnia"** — All things. Everything. Totality.
- **"Fortis"** — Strength. Endurance. Bravery. Power.

Together, they mean:  
> **All Strength. Everywhere. In All Things.**

This name isn’t just branding — it’s doctrine.  
The app reflects an ancient ideal: the relentless pursuit of personal evolution — physically, mentally, and spiritually.

Imagine Sparta meets software. Marble meets modern. Leonidas in a hoodie.

## Vision

OmniaFortis is a **full-stack personal performance engine** for the modern hybrid athlete:

- 💪 Tracks **lifting**: powerlifting, bodybuilding, Olympic lifting  
- 🧠 Logs **mindset**: discipline, sleep, focus, fatigue  
- 🥦 Supports **nutrition**: calories, macros, hydration  
- 📊 Shows **progress**: visual dashboards for every tracked dimension  
- 🔁 Adapts to **phases**: bulking, cutting, recovery, peak  
- ⚙️ Integrates **multi-sport** methods: calisthenics, sprinting, endurance

> It is a temple — one that evolves as you do.

## Philosophy

This is not for influencers.  
This is not a white-labeled routine pusher.  
This is for athletes, grinders, and lifters who treat performance as identity.

> **"Train like a god. Track like a genius."**

| Layer     | Stack                           |
|-----------|----------------------------------|
| Frontend  | React Native + Expo (TypeScript) |
| Storage   | AsyncStorage (local-first MVP)   |
| State     | Context API + hooks              |
| Design    | Dark-mode-first, high-contrast   |
| Backend   | (Planned: Supabase or Firebase)  |

## Core Features (MVP)

- Workout Logging (barbell, bodyweight, Olympic)
- Mindset Tracker (mood, focus, sleep quality)
- Nutrition Tracker (macros, hydration)
- Dashboard View (progress streaks, visual stats)
- Phase Planning (cut, bulk, maintain, deload)

---

## Roadmap

### ⚔️ Phase I: Base Tracker (v1)
- Log lifts (sets x reps x weight)
- Track daily mood, sleep, soreness
- Save logs offline

### 🛡️ Phase II: Dashboard + Nutrition
- Visual streaks, trendlines, progress rings
- Macro tracker + water logging

### 🧠 Phase III: Intelligence
- Add stimulus-to-fatigue ratio (SFR) tracker
- Recommend deloads or volume shifts
- Graph fatigue vs PRs (NeuroLift concept)
