> A codebase forged in discipline, built to pursue strength in every domain.  
> Built for hybrid athletes.

## The Origin

**OmniaFortis** draws its name from Latin roots:
- **"Omnia"** - All things. Everything. Totality.
- **"Fortis"** - Strength. Endurance. Power.

Together, they mean:  
> **All Strength. Everywhere. In All Things.**

The app reflects an ancient ideal: the relentless pursuit of personal evolution physically, mentally, and spiritually.

Imagine Sparta meets software. Marble meets modern. Leonidas in a hoodie.

## Vision

OmniaFortis is a **full-stack personal performance engine** for the modern hybrid athlete:

- Tracks **lifting**: powerlifting, bodybuilding, Olympic lifting  
- Logs **mindset**: discipline, sleep, focus, fatigue  
- Supports **nutrition**: calories, macros, hydration  
- Shows **progress**: visual dashboards for every tracked dimension  
- Adapts to **phases**: bulking, cutting, recovery, peak  
- Integrates **multi-sport** methods: calisthenics, sprinting, endurance

 **Train like a god. Track like a genius.**

## Tech Stack (v1)

| Layer     | Stack                           |
|-----------|----------------------------------|
| Frontend  | React Native + Expo (TypeScript) |
| Storage   | AsyncStorage (local-first MVP)   |
| State     | Context API + hooks              |
| Design    | Dark-mode-first, high-contrast   |
| Backend   | (Planned: Supabase or Firebase)  |

---

## Core Features (MVP)

- Workout Logging (barbell, bodyweight, Olympic)
- Mindset Tracker (mood, focus, sleep quality)
- Nutrition Tracker (macros, hydration)
- Dashboard View (progress streaks, visual stats)
- Phase Planning (cut, bulk, maintain, deload)

---

## Roadmap

### Phase I: Base Tracker (v1)
- Log lifts (sets x reps x weight)
- Track daily mood, sleep, soreness
- Save logs offline

### Phase II: Dashboard + Nutrition
- Visual streaks, trendlines, progress rings
- Macro tracker + water logging

### Phase III: Intelligence
- Add stimulus-to-fatigue ratio (SFR) tracker
- Recommend deloads or volume shifts
- Graph fatigue vs PRs (NeuroLift concept)
